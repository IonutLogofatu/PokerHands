# PokerHands

## About

This project is a program that determines the winner of a 5-card poker hand.

## How it works

This project starts by writing in a file 10 hands of 10 random cards, 5 for one player and 5 for the other. 
Then for each player some checks are run to see what combination they have. 
If they both have the same combination, then it is decided who has the highest combination. 
If it happens to be a tie again, the highest card is taken, and if the highest card is equal, then a tie is declared between the two.

## What I like and what I do not

The most important thing I like about this project is that I managed to break this project into as many classes as possible so that 
it could be as modular.
One thing I don't like is that I could have written cleaner code and had better complexity.

## What was new for me

At this point, just the Comparator approach was new for me.

## I hope you enjoy this new project of mine.
